In light of recent events regarding WebStatus.dev / Web Platform Status and Vaadin Web Components, I have compiled a manifest of what could benefit all Open Source contributors. For the case against WebStatus and Vaadin and any other related parties, see clientsidenetworkcontrol repo below this article. Thank you =)

Here are a few thoughts on how this could work in practice:

**Retention of an "Origin Trail" in Source Documentation**

*Imagine* if every feature or experimental concept came with an embedded "origin trail" in its documentation. For instance, when a new browser API or a CSS feature is introduced on MDN or similar platforms, there could be a minimal dedicated section that explains its genesis like the credits of a movie or the dedication of a novel to it's inspiration.
A section that might include:

- **Citations and References**: Links back to the original proposal, technical blog posts, or even the experimental repository where the idea first appeared.
- **Contributor Profiles**: Short bios or links to the profiles of the individuals or teams that first developed the idea.
- **Version History**: A clear timeline showing how the feature has evolved through commits, discussions, and public experimentation.

*This not only validates the innovative work but also creates a historical record—something developers can reference if they need to understand the context or to further their own projects.*

**Enhanced Attribution in Version Control Systems**

Another approach could be tighter coupling of contributions with the projects they feed into:
Forking vs. Cloning: As mentioned, a rule could be set up where repositories of experimental features are forked rather than simply cloned. With forks, the provenance is maintained, allowing for clear links between the original work and subsequent iterations. Every update or merge from the original source could be neatly tracked.
- Attribution Tags: Similar to commit signatures, projects could use metadata tags or even blockchain-like identifiers that ensure every contribution—no matter how experimental—is permanently linked back to its originator.
- Origin Nodes: Think of these as "anchor points" in the repository that serve as checkpoints for major contributions or milestones. They would help maintain a lineage of ideas even as the code diverges into various experimental and production branches.

**Note**:
### There are real benefits in integrating this idea into major developer documentations and repositories

3. Platforms and Documentation Standards
Dedicated Sections for Innovation: MDN and similar platforms could have sections like "Origins and Evolution of [Feature X]" that include interactive timelines or even video interviews with the original contributors.

Open Attribution Systems: A standardized system across platforms could make it easier for both readers and developers to trace back an experimental concept to its source. This might even extend to citation frameworks similar to academic papers, which would finally formalize attribution in software development.

4. Community and Ecosystem Benefits
Maintaining origin trails and enhanced lead attribution has a ripple effect across the community:

Collaboration and Inspiration: When innovators are recognized, it encourages a more collaborative spirit. Others might approach the original creators to discuss potential enhancements, leading to richer, more robust project ecosystems.

Accountability and Recognition: With clear attribution, it’s easier to acknowledge who contributed what, ensuring that any future successes are rightly credited. This transparency could also guard against issues like code plagiarism or uncredited reuse in commercial settings.

# HONORING COPYRIGHT & RESTRICTIONS IN COLLABORATIONS

Unauthorized usage, reproduction, modification, or distribution of unlicensed original works—whether in whole or in part—violates copyright.

**Consider**:

Imagine spending countless hours designing and building a car. Collaboration is vital, but what if others take your blueprint, improve it behind closed doors, and leave you out? You miss out on valuable learning and see no benefit for your effort. They lose out on your contributions to further the work. 

This is why **permission and attribution** matter.
